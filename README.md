# Airbnb Clone Project

This is a full-stack clone of the Airbnb booking platform. The goal is to build a real working web app where users can search for properties, see details, and make bookings.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Design Tool:** Figma
## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Create an easy-to-use booking flow
- Keep everything looking clean and consistent
- Make pages load fast
- Work well on phones (mobile-first)

### Key Features
- Search for properties and use filters
- View all details of a selected property
- Secure checkout with booking confirmation
- User login and signup

### Primary Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Shows a grid of all available properties with search and filter options |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Full page showing one property with pictures and a booking form |
| **Simple Checkout View** | Page to pay and confirm booking easily |

### Why User-Friendly Design Matters

If a booking system is easy to use, people will trust it and use it more. Simple navigation and fast loading means users are happy and more likely to finish their bookings.
